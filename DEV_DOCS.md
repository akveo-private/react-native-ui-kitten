- tests are added/updated and passing
- showcase in the playground updated
- tsdocs added/updated
- commit message is properly formatted
- for the override styles - registered in a list of overrides
- looks great on all default themes
- requires approval from several core team contributors

# Docs

Docs is a separate Angular application located right in this project in [docs](./docs) folder.
The pages structure is taken from `structure.ts` file.
The components documentation is taken from the component comment sections. 

# Framework Structure

- docs - Documentation and framework website built on top on the framework
- src
    - playground - independent module with runnable examples for each feature
    - framework - Framework itself, represents the npm package     
      
## UI Kit 

Located in [./src/framework](./src/framework). Divided into two dirs:

- [theme](./src/framework/theme) - Contains styling services and supporting components used to provide styles to basic components.
- [ui](./src/framework/ui) - Contains basic UI components.

## Styling services

Located in [./src/framework/theme](./src/framework/theme)

- [theme](./src/framework/theme/theme) - ThemeProvider component. Used to provide one of Eva themes used to style basic components.
- [mapping](./src/framework/theme/mapping) - MappingProvider component. Used to provide one of Eva mappings to style basic components.
- [style](./src/framework/theme/style) - StyleProvider components. This mixes both Theme- and Mapping- providers to provide usable basic component style object.
- [application](./src/framework/theme/application) - Global ApplicationProvider component. This mixes StyleProvider implementation with Eva processing engine.

### Basic UI components

Located in [./src/framework/ui](./src/framework/ui)

Each component implementation can be found in a directory with the corresponding name.

#### UI component directory structure:

- `*.component.tsx` - component implementation itself.
- `*.spec.tsx` - component tests.
- `*.spec.tsx.snap` - component test snapshots. This is a generated file. Could be presented or not depending on tests.

Some of the components can have a more complex implementation. In this case, the final component implementation could be divided into sub-components, but tests should be written in a single `*.spec` file. The good example is [TabView](./src/framework/ui/tab). 
   
   
# Documentation

Documentation is generated by the custom generator built on top of UI Kit.
You have to use typedoc everywhere for the documentation purpose.

## How to add a page to the documentation

Docs application split into the sections which you can find in the app's sidebar.
Each section contains some pages.
If you wanna add new page in the documentation, please, open `structure.ts`
file in the root of docs application and add a new page in the required section:

```
{
  type: 'page',
  name: 'Awesom page',
  children: [
    ... blocks
  ],
},
```

If it's a completely new feature, maybe it would be better to create a new section:

```
{
  type: 'section',
  name: 'New super section',
  children: [
    ... pages
  ],
},
```

Page can contain multiple blocks of the following types:

- [markdown](#markdown-block)
- [component](#component-block)
- [tabbed component](#tabbed-component-block)

### Markdown block

Renders plain markdown file from the `articles` dir.
For example, if you wanna add getting started article you have to do the following:

- put `getting-started.md` file in the `articles` folder.
- add markdown block to the page children:

```
{
  type: 'block',
  block: 'markdown',
  source: 'getting-started.md',
},
```

### Component block

If you have to render all the information about component parsed with typedoc
you have to use component blocks:

```
{
  type: 'block',
  block: 'component',
  source: 'MyNewComponentName',
},
```

### Tabbed component block

Tabbed component block will render component description splitted on the following tabs:
- Overview - This is typedoc comment above component
- Theme - Theme variables listed in the typedoc comment above component with `@styles` tag, for example:

```
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @styles
 *
 * var1
 * var2
 *
 * ...
 */
```

- API - parsing result of the typedoc above public methods and props
- Examples - live examples listed in the typedoc comment above component

## Examples

When you're developing new functionality, please, always add some examples describing it.
You have the following ways to add examples in your component documentation:
- [Add raw code](#add-raw-code)

### Add raw code

If you wan't to describe a small thing in two lines of code you can just add something similar in your typedoc comment:

````
```jsx
const AwesomeComponentShowcase = () => (
  <AwesomeComponent/>
);
```
````

And don't forget to specify the language above your example.

## Development

## Create a new component

- create directory in `./src/framework/ui/awesomeComponent` with following files:
````
- awesomeComponent.component.tsx (component file)
- awesomeComponent.spec.tsx (component tests)
````

- create directory in `./src/playground/src/ui/screen/awesomeComponent` with following files:
````
- awesomeComponent.container.tsx (component showcase container)
- awesomeComponentShowcase.component.tsx (basic component showcase)
- type.tsx (component configuration file)
````

Look through already existing showcases and use similar implementation (e.g [Button Showcase](./src/playground/src/ui/screen/button))

- register your showcase in a playground: 

Open `./src/playground/src/navigation/navigation.component.tsx` and expand playground navigation with your component container:
```
import {
  ...
  AwesomeComponentContainer,
} from '../ui/screen';
...
[Awesome Component]: AwesomeComponentContainer
```

## Release

0. For major version, search for `@breaking-change` to make sure all breaking changes are covered.

To start a new release (publish the framework packages on NPM) you need:

1. Create a new release branch with template `release/vX.X.X`
3. Run tests: `yarn release:validate`
3. MANUALLY update a version in main ./package.json to a new one
4. Generate documentation if needed: `yarn docs:start`
5. Generate changelog: `yarn release:changelog`
6. Fix/expand changelog manually
7. Update documentation (e.g [DEV_DOCS.md](./DEV_DOCS.md)) files if needed
8. Push the branch, create PR, approve - merge
9. Pull the upstream (master or another version branch (e.g. 4.0.1, next))   
10. Run tests: `yarn release:validate`
11. Assemble build: `yarn release:prepare`
12. Publish the package to npm: `yarn release`
13. Create and push [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) with template `(vX.X.X)`
14. Create release on GitHub for the tag

# Playground

Playground is an example app built on top of the [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) containing runnable component examples.

## Start a Playground

`yarn && yarn playground start` from the project root

### Playground environments:

Playground module supports two environments: 

- **Production** (Provides Eva Design System module published to npm)
- **Development** (Provides local Eva Design System module)

To run playground in a development mode:

- Clone Eva Design System to the directory containing UI Kitten repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eva-design/eva
```
- Ensure you have the following structure of repos:
```
- /Users/KittenDeveloper/
  - react-native-ui-kitten
  - eva
```
- Install dependencies if needed and finally run `yarn playground start:dev`

# Kitten Tricks

## Start an App

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/akveo/kittenTricks`
2. Go to the Kitten Tricks project dir and run `npm i && npm start`

## Kitten Tricks environments:

Kitten Tricks app supports two environments: 

- **Production** (Provides Eva Design System and UI Kitten modules published to npm)
- **Development** (Provides local Eva Design System and UI Kitten modules)

To run App in a development mode:

- Clone UI Kitten to the directory containing Kitten Tricks repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten
```
- Clone Eva Design System to the directory containing Kitten Tricks repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eva-design/eva
```
- Ensure you have the following structure of repos:
```
- /Users/KittenDeveloper/
  - react-native-ui-kitten
  - eva
  - kittenTricks
```
- Inside react-native-ui-kitten dir run `rm -rf ./node_modules ./package-lock.json && npm i` to install latest dependencies.
- Inside Kitten Tricks directory `rm -rf ./node_modules ./package-lock.json && npm i` to install the latest dependencies.
- `npm run start:dev` - this will start application in development mode and watch for UI Kitten and Eva changes.
