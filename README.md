<h1 align="center">react-ui-kitten</h1>

`react-ui-kitten` is the web version of `react-native-ui-kitten`, the original project, developed by [Akveo](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/). It is an awesome framework that contains a set of commonly used UI components with constant styles across Android, IOS and now the web.

I was such a fan of `react-native-ui-kitten`'s UI components, that I decided to not only make use of it in my `react-native` apps, but also in my web / `electron` apps. So that my apps could have a single suite across devices. This is why I forked and added support for the web to `react-native-ui-kitten`.

All who find this useful should start and thank the `react-native-ui-kitten` developers - whom without this project would not be possible.

I'll be sure to soon release a sample web app with `electron` and this framework in order to display its goodies. In the meantime, here's a desktop chat app built with `react-ui-kitten`:

## Documentation
Documentation for `react-ui-kitten`  could be found [here](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) at the `react-native-ui-kitten` developers' site.

**Note**: I haven't altered or made any drastic changes to the framework's core features, so that the documentation of the original package remains relevant to this as well. Therefore, there's no need to learn a new API for the previous users.

Enjoy! :)
