<h1 align="center">react-ui-kitten</h1>

`react-ui-kitten` is the web version of `react-native-ui-kitten`, the original project, developed by [Akveo](https://akveo.github.io/). It is an awesome framework that contains a set of commonly used UI components with constant styles across Android, IOS and now the web.

I was such a fan of `react-native-ui-kitten`'s UI components, that I decided I'd like to make use of it not only in my `react-native` apps, but also in my web apps.

Great thanks to the `react-native-ui-kitten` developers whom without this project would not be possible.

## Documentation
Documentation for `react-ui-kitten`  could both be found [here](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) at the `react-native-ui-kitten` developers' site.
**Note**: I haven't altered the framework's core features, so the documentation of the original package will still be relevant to this as well.

Enjoy! :)
