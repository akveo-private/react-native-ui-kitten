# Change Current Theme

UI Kitten Theme System has support of 2 built-in Eva Design System color schemes - `light` and `dark`. It is both possible to change the theme statically and dynamically during the runtime.

## Runtime Theme Switch

It is extremely simple to replace a theme from one to another.
All you need to do is to find a way of how you notify `ApplicationProvider` component about theme change.
Let's take a look on example when you want to switch theme from `HomeScreen` component.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Layout, Button } from 'react-native-ui-kitten';

export const HomeScreen = (props) => (
  <Layout style={styles.container}>
    <Button onPress={props.toggleTheme}>Switch theme</Button>
  </Layout>
);
```

We're going to switch theme by pressing a Button. In this case - the simplest way we can do is passing a `toggleTheme` prop into `HomeScreen` component. Let's go back to `App` component and implement this.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { mapping, light } from '@eva-design/eva';
import { ApplicationProvider } from 'react-native-ui-kitten';
import { HomeScreen } from './path-to/home.component';

const App = () => {
  
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    // ðŸŒž -> ðŸŒš
  };
  
  return (
    <ApplicationProvider mapping={mapping} theme={light}>
      <HomeScreen toggleTheme={toggleTheme}/>
    </ApplicationProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now we should only modify `toggleTheme` function. To do that, let's take a look on the snippet below:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { ApplicationProvider } from 'react-native-ui-kitten';
import { mapping, light, dark } from '@eva-design/eva'; // <-- Import both Light and Dark themes
import { HomeScreen } from './path-to/home.component';

const themes = { light, dark };

const App = () => {

  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const nextTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    setTheme(nextTheme);
  };

  return (
    <ApplicationProvider mapping={mapping} theme={themes[theme]}>
      <HomeScreen toggleTheme={toggleTheme}/>
    </ApplicationProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Import both light and dark themes and set them into a `themes` object. Thenâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe pass the name of the initial theme into the `useState` hook. This will allow us saving the current theme in the application state. And when `toggleTheme` is calledâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe call the `setTheme` function returned from that hook to apply a dark or light theme depending on the current theme. Notice that in this example we donâ€™t store any theme object, but just itâ€™s key.

And thatâ€™s it! Now your app can support both Light and Dark modes.

## About state management

We don't force you to implement theme switching using props. This is just a short guide of how it can be done. Working with a real production apps you're also able to implement this with other powerful state management tools like [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
