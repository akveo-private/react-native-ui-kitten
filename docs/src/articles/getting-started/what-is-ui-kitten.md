# What is UI Kitten?

**UI Kitten** is a framework of UI components powered by Eva Design System for your next React Native application.

The primary feature of UI Kitten components is to simplify the development process giving you easy-to-use React Native components styled pretty out of the box. It also includes a nice and powerful theme system, which allows you to quickly modify components or even build your own with ease.
