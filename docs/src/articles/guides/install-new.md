## Create a New Project

A new project can be created using React Native CLI tools ant UI Kitten template.

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-ui-kitten
```

Or, if you want to init with TypeScript:
```bash
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-ui-kitten-typescript
```

That's it. UI Kitten is ready now. For the next steps, simply follow command line instructions.
