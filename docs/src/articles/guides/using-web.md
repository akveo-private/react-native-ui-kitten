Starting from version 4.1, UI Kitten has built-in support for use in web sites using <a href='https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web' target='_blank'>React Native Web</a>.

  This has not yet been widely used in production and we consider thus feature to be experimental. However, you can follow instructions below to configure your app running in browser.

## Starting from a scratch

In case you're going to start your project from a scratch, follow the <a href='https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/docs/guides/install-into-existing-app' target='_blank'>Installation Guide</a>. This will create an Expo application with all needed configuration done. After that, simply follow **Usage Guides**.

## Existing Expo Applications

Read the great documentation from Expo team to <a href='https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/running-in-the-browser/#adding-web-support-to-expo-projects' target='_blank'>add web support in existing Expo projects</a>.

## Regular React Native Applications

In case you don't use Expo, and have already initialized React Native Application using `react-native init`, please follow <a href='https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/blob/master/docs/guides/multi-platform-apps.md#web-packaging-for-existing-react-native-apps' target='_blank'>official React Native Web Guide</a>.

## Usage

If you already have all in place, UI Kitten does not force you creating any additional web-specific configuration. Just use it as is. The next step to create a multi-platform app would be [Creating a Sample Screen Guide](guides/create-ui-kitten-screen) and launching it on both mobile device and browser.
