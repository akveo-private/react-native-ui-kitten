# What is React Native UI Kitten?

**React Native UI Kitten** is a framework of UI components powered by Eva Design System for your next React Native application.

The primary feature of React Native UI Kitten components is to simplify the development process giving you easy-to-use React Native components styled pretty out of the box. It also includes a nice and powerful theme system, which allows you to quickly modify components or even build your own with ease.

## The purpose

There are a lot of awesome UI frameworks for React Native out there these days. 
They provide a massive quantity of useful features making our lives more comfortable. 
Our intention is not to create a new one as we are pretty much aware of the complexity and amount of work developers put on their creations. 
We are on a mission to build a UI framework that allows you build your app faster and easier, giving you a possibility to build your app with less styling effort (our components look nice *out of the box*, really ðŸ˜¼). Just give it a try.
